`openTrades: () => requests.get(\"/trades/open\")`\n  - `tradeHistory: () => requests.get(\"/trades/history\")`\n\n### Step 5: Create OpenTrades Component\n- Create `app/client/src/components/OpenTrades.jsx`\n- Accept `trades` array and `loading` state as props\n- Use the table styles from `index.css` (table, table-header, table-body, table-row, table-head, table-cell)\n- Display columns: Instrument, Side, Amount, Entry Price, Current P/L, Margin, SL, TP\n- Use `card` component styling for the container\n- Add loading skeleton state following `AccountSummary.jsx` pattern\n- Use `text-success` for positive P/L, `text-destructive` for negative P/L\n- Show empty state message when no trades exist\n\n### Step 6: Create OrderHistory Component\n- Create `app/client/src/components/OrderHistory.jsx`\n- Accept `history` array and `loading` state as props\n- Use table styles consistent with OpenTrades component\n- Display columns: Date, Instrument, Side, Amount, Entry Price, Exit Price, P/L\n- Add card styling and loading skeleton state\n- Show empty state when no history exists\n\n### Step 7: Create Account Page\n- Create `app/client/src/pages/Account.jsx`\n- Follow the layout pattern from `Home.jsx` and `Dashboard.jsx`\n- Include page header with title \"Account\" and description\n- Implement `useEffect` to load data on mount\n- Call `endPoints.openTrades()` and `endPoints.tradeHistory()` on load\n- Manage loading state for initial page load\n- Layout: Stack OpenTrades and OrderHistory vertically with gap-6 spacing\n- Add appropriate icons from lucide-react (e.g., Briefcase, History, TrendingUp)\n\n### Step 8: Add Route to App.jsx\n- In `app/client/src/App.jsx`, import the new Account page\n- Add route: `<Route exact path=\"/account\" element={<Account />} />`\n\n### Step 9: Update NavigationBar\n- In `app/client/src/components/NavigationBar.jsx`, add Account to navItems:\n  ```javascript\n  { href: \"/account\", label: \"Account\" }\n  ```\n\n### Step 10: Add Unit Tests for Backend Endpoints\n- In `app/server/tests/`, add tests for the new API endpoints\n- Test successful response for `/api/trades/open`\n- Test successful response for `/api/trades/history`\n- Test error handling scenarios\n\n### Step 11: Run Validation Commands\n- Run all validation commands listed below to ensure feature works correctly with zero regressions\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- Test `/api/trades/open` endpoint returns correct response structure\n- Test `/api/trades/open` endpoint handles API errors gracefully\n- Test `/api/trades/history` endpoint returns correct response structure\n- Test OpenTradesResponse model validation\n- Test TradeInfo model validation\n\n### Edge Cases\n- No open trades (empty array)\n- No trade history (empty array)\n- API connection failure\n- Invalid data from external API\n- Large number of trades (pagination consideration for future)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Account page is accessible via navigation bar link\n- [ ] Open Trades section displays all currently active trading positions\n- [ ] Each open trade shows: instrument, side (buy/sell), amount, entry price, current P/L, margin used, stop loss, take profit\n- [ ] Order History section displays historical/closed trades\n- [ ] Loading states are shown while data is being fetched\n- [ ] Empty states are shown when no trades or history exist\n- [ ] Styling is consistent with the rest of the application (follows style guide)\n- [ ] Backend endpoints return data in the documented format\n- [ ] All existing tests pass (zero regressions)\n- [ ] Frontend build completes successfully\n- [ ] E2E test validates the feature works end-to-end\n\n## Validation Commands\nExecute every command to validate the feature works correctly with zero regressions.\n\n- `cd app/server && uv run pytest` - Run server tests to validate the feature works with zero regressions\n- `cd app/client && npm run build` - Run frontend build to validate the feature works with zero regressions\n- Read `.claude/commands/test_e2e.md`, then read and execute `.claude/commands/e2e/test_account_page.md` to validate this functionality works end-to-end\n\n## Notes\n- The OpenFX API already has a `get_open_trades()` method in `openfx_api.py` that returns `List[OpenTrade]` - this should be leveraged for the open trades endpoint\n- The `OpenTradesResponse` and `TradeInfo` models already exist in `data_models.py` - these can be used directly\n- Trade history may not be available from the OpenFX API - check API documentation. If not available, implement a placeholder endpoint that returns an empty response with a message indicating the feature is limited by the external API\n- The existing `OpenTrade` model in `models/open_trade.py` has a `to_dict()` method that can be used for serialization\n- Follow the exact styling patterns from existing components - use `card`, `card-header`, `card-title`, `card-content` classes\n- Use tabular-nums class for financial numbers to ensure proper alignment\n- Consider adding a refresh button to allow users to manually update the data\n","numLines":200,"startLine":1,"totalLines":200}}}

If any errors occur and assertions fail, mark the test as failed and explain exactly what went wrong.\n\n## Application Overview\n\nThe Forex Trading Dashboard is a full-stack application for forex trading with:\n\n- **Frontend (React 18)**: `app/client/` - React with React Router v6, Tailwind CSS, Plotly.js charts\n  - Routes: Home (`/`), Dashboard (`/dashboard`)\n  - Components: AccountSummary, Headlines, PriceChart, Technicals, NavigationBar, Select\n  \n- **Backend (FastAPI)**: `app/server/` - Python FastAPI with UV package manager\n  - Health: `/api/test`, `/api/health`\n  - Market Data: `/api/headlines`, `/api/options`\n  - Trading: `/api/account`, `/api/technicals/{pair}/{tf}`, `/api/prices/{pair}/{gran}/{count}`\n  - API Docs: `/docs` (Swagger UI), `/redoc` (ReDoc)\n\n## Variables\n\n| Variable | Description | Default |\n|----------|-------------|---------|\n| `adw_id` | Unique workflow identifier | `$1` if provided, otherwise generate random 8 character hex string |\n| `agent_name` | Agent executing the test | `$2` if provided, otherwise `test_e2e` |\n| `e2e_test_file` | Path to the E2E test specification | `$3` (required) |\n| `application_url` | Base URL for the frontend application | `$4` if provided, otherwise `http://localhost:3000` |\n\n## Test File Location\n\nE2E test specifications are located in `.claude/commands/e2e/`:\n- `test_api_health.md` - Backend API health and connectivity tests\n- `test_trading_dashboard.md` - Dashboard functionality tests\n- `test_market_headlines.md` - Home page and headlines tests\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Phase 1: Preparation\n\n1. Read the `e2e_test_file` specified in the variables\n2. Digest the `User Story` to understand what functionality is being validated\n3. Note the `Success Criteria` to understand pass/fail conditions\n\n### Phase 2: Setup\n\nExecute `.claude/commands/prepare_app.md` to ensure the application is running:\n- Backend API should be running on `http://localhost:8000`\n- Frontend should be running on `http://localhost:3000`\n\n### Phase 3: Test Execution\n\n1. **Initialize Playwright browser** in headed mode for visibility\n2. Navigate to the `application_url`\n3. **Execute each `Test Step`** from the test file in sequence\n4. For each **Verify** step:\n   - Check the assertion\n   - If it fails, immediately mark the test as failed\n   - Format failure as: `(Step N ❌) [Step description] - [Error details]`\n5. **Capture screenshots** as specified in the test steps\n6. Allow time for async operations and element visibility (React state updates, API calls)\n\n### Phase 4: Screenshot Management\n\nSave screenshots to the designated directory with descriptive names:\n\n**Directory Structure:**\n```\n<codebase_root>/agents/<adw_id>/<agent_name>/img/<test_directory_name>/\n```\n\n**Naming Convention:**\n```\n01_<descriptive_name>.png\n02_<descriptive_name>.png\n```\n\nExample for `test_trading_dashboard.md` with `adw_id=abc12345` and `agent_name=e2e_tester`:\n```\n/path/to/codebase/agents/abc12345/e2e_tester/img/trading_dashboard/01_initial_home_page.png\n```\n\nUse `pwd` or equivalent to get the absolute path to the codebase for correct screenshot paths.\n\n### Phase 5: Error Handling\n\nIf you encounter an error:\n1. Mark the test as **failed** immediately\n2. Report the exact step where the failure occurred\n3. Include the specific error message\n4. Example: `(Step 3 ❌) Failed to find element with selector \"pair-selector\" on page \"http://localhost:3000/dashboard\"`\n\n## Common Test Scenarios\n\n### Frontend Elements to Test\n\n| Element | Selector Hints | Pages |\n|---------|----------------|-------|\n| Navigation Bar | nav links, Home/Dashboard | All |\n| Account Summary | balance, margin, P/L fields | Home |\n| Headlines | headline items, links | Home |\n| Pair Selector | dropdown with EUR_USD, GBP_JPY, etc. | Dashboard |\n| Timeframe Selector | M5, M15, H1, H4, D options | Dashboard |\n| Price Chart | Plotly candlestick chart | Dashboard |\n| Technicals | support/resistance levels | Dashboard |\n\n### API Endpoints to Test\n\n| Endpoint | Expected Response |\n|----------|-------------------|\n| `GET /api/health` | `{\"status\": \"ok\", \"service\": \"forex-trading-api\", ...}` |\n| `GET /api/test` | `{\"message\": \"Forex Trading API is running!\"}` |\n| `GET /api/options` | `{\"pairs\": [...], \"granularities\": [...]}` |\n| `GET /api/headlines` | `{\"headlines\": [...], \"count\": N}` |\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn results in the following JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"test_name\": \"Test Name Here\",\n  \"status\": \"passed|failed\",\n  \"steps_completed\": 5,\n  \"total_steps\": 10,\n  \"screenshots\": [\n    \"<absolute_path>/agents/<adw_id>/<agent_name>/img/<test_name>/01_<descriptive_name>.png\",\n    \"<absolute_path>/agents/<adw_id>/<agent_name>/img/<test_name>/02_<descriptive_name>.png\"\n  ],\n  \"error\": null,\n  \"failed_step\": null\n}\n```\n\n### On Failure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"test_name\": \"Test Name Here\",\n  \"status\": \"failed\",\n  \"steps_completed\": 3,\n  \"total_steps\": 10,\n  \"screenshots\": [\n    \"<absolute_path>/agents/<adw_id>/<agent_name>/img/<test_name>/01_<descriptive_name>.png\"\n  ],\n  \"error\": \"Element 'pair-selector' not found on Dashboard page\",\n  \"failed_step\": \"(Step 4 ❌) Verify pair selector dropdown is present\"\n}\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Think deeply** about each test step before executing\n2. **Wait for elements** to be visible before interacting (React renders asynchronously)\n3. **Wait for API responses** when testing data-dependent components\n4. **Use absolute paths** for all screenshot operations\n5. **Create directories** if they don't exist before saving screenshots\n6. **Review Success Criteria** at the end to ensure all conditions are met\n7. **Capture intermediate screenshots** to document the test flow even on failure\n\n## Integration with ADW\n\nThis test runner integrates with the AI Developer Workflow (ADW) system:\n- Screenshots are stored in the ADW workspace: `agents/{adw_id}/`\n- Test results can be consumed by `adw_test.py` for automated testing\n- Failed tests can be resolved using `.claude/commands/resolve_failed_e2e_test.md`\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}
